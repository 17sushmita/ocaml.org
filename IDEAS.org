* Components (code to develop)

- user accounts (forge, openID, google, linkedin, yahoo, facebook)
- wiki
- listing of the project on the forge
- searching email lists

* Wiki

- Choice or markup (define an abstract interface, implement
  several concrete syntax).
- syntax highlighting
- comment system
- history of changes
- export to several formats, e.g. LaTeX, PDF (low priority).

IMPORTANT GOALS: support writing tutorial with ease.  A comment system
per paragraph is a plus.

* IRC

http://www.mibbit.com/ might be interesting for newcomers.  Firefox
proposes it when one clicks on the URL in index.html.  Freenode does
not seem to be available though.

# Commercial Support

A great way to get free support is by using the active [mailing
lists](mailing_lists.html). When you need to go beyond this and get
professional support, you have the following options:

## The OCamlPro Company

[OCamlPro](http://www.ocamlpro.com/) is the creator of many open-source tools
widely used throughout the community, such as
[Try OCaml](http://try.ocamlpro.com/), the
[OPAM package manager](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/) and
[ocp-indent](http://www.typerex.org/ocp-indent.html), as well as a
[large contributor](http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2012/08/20/ocamlpro-and-4.00.0.html)
to OCaml itself. Besides commercially supporting their tools, they offer to
share their expertise through
full OCaml support packages.
They also provide trainings and specialized software developments.

OCamlPro is an INRIA spin-off with a team of highly skilled experienced OCaml
programmers, including members of the OCaml core development team, and they have
expertise to help debug and optimize OCaml projects as well as improve specific
work environments. See details [here](http://www.ocamlpro.com/)

## Gerd Stolpmann
[Gerd Stolpmann](http://www.gerd-stolpmann.de/buero/work_ocaml_search.html.en)
has been helping companies master OCaml since 2005. He is
an expert of the ecosystem surrounding OCaml and developed the
[GODI](http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/) platform. Stolpmann is a computer
scientist who has been a contractor for several long-running OCaml
projects. He has a focus on big data (including data preparation,
search/query engines, map/reduce), but his skills also cover Unix system
programming, SQL databases, client/server, compiler development (e.g.
for domain-specific languages), and much more. Also visit his [website
on OCaml](http://camlcity.org).

## [Caml Consortium at Inria](/consortium/)

        language FAQ</a>.  Maybe we have to revisit it using the tools
        that we have today.  For example, for the first question,
        <code>#require "num"</code> would be the preferred way of
        loading nums and setting up a printer.  Also, I think on
        should show how delimited overloading makes thing easier.

	<div class="Q">What is OCaml?</div>
	<div class="A">
	  OCaml is a programming language. It is a functional
	  language, since the basic units of programs are
	  functions.  It is a strongly-typed language; it means that
	  the objects that you use belong to a set that has a name,
	  called its type.  In OCaml, types are managed by the computer,
	  the user has nothing to do about types (types are
	  synthesized).  The language is available on almost every
	  Unix platform (including Linux and MacOS X) and on PCs under
	  Windows.  A brief tour on main <a
	  href="description.html" >features</a> of OCaml.
	</div>

	<div class="Q">
	  What is the meaning of the name &#8220;OCaml&#8221;
	</div>
	<div class="A">
	  &#8220;Caml&#8221; is an acronym: it stands for
	  &#8220;Categorical Abstract Machine Language&#8221;. The
	  &#8220;Categorical Abstract Machine&#8221; is an abstract
	  machine to define and execute functions. It is issued from
	  theoretical considerations on the relationship between
	  category theory and lambda-calculus. The first Caml compiler
	  produced code for this abstract machine (in 1984).  The
	  &#8220;O&#8221; stands for &#8220;Objective&#8221; and was
	  added after object oriented features were available in the
	  language.
	  <br />
	  In addition, OCaml is issued from the ML programming
	  language, designed by Robin Milner in 1978, and used as the
	  programming language to write the &#8220;proof
	  tactics&#8221; in the LCF proof system.
	</div>

	<div class="Q">
	  Do you write &#8220;Caml&#8221; or &#8220;CAML&#8221;,
	  &#8220;OCaml&#8221;, &#8220;Ocaml&#8221; or
	  &#8220;OCAML&#8221;?
	</div>
	<div class="A">
	  We write OCaml.  <br /> According to usual rules for
	  acronyms, we should write CAML, as we write USA or Inria. On
	  the other hand, this upper case name seems to yell all over
	  the place, and writing OCaml is far more pretty and elegant
	  â€” with  &#8220;O&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8221; capitalized.
	</div>

	<div class="Q">
	  Is OCaml a compiled or interpreted language?
	</div>
	<div class="A">
          OCaml is compiled.  However each OCaml compiler offers a
          top-level interactive loop, that is similar to an
          interpreter. In fact, in the interactive system, the user
          may type in program chunks (we call these pieces OCaml
          &#8220;phrases&#8221;) that the system handles at once,
          compiling them, executing them, and writing their results.
	</div>

	<div class="Q">
	  What are the differences between Caml V3.1, Caml Light, and
	  OCaml?
	</div>
	<div class="A">
	  These are different Caml implementations that have been
	  developed successively at Inria.  These systems share many
	  features since they all implement the core of the OCaml
	  language; so the basic syntax is nearly the same.  However,
	  all these systems have their own extensions to the Caml core
	  language.
	  <br />
	  Caml V3.1 is no longer maintained nor distributed.  <a
	  href="caml-light/" >Caml
	  Light</a> is no longer developed, but still maintained.
	  Because of its stable status, it is actively used in
	  education.  Most other users have switched to OCaml, the
	  latest variant of the language.  This is the version we
	  suggest using in new software developments. See our brief <a
	  href="history.html" >history</a> of the OCaml language.
	</div>

	<div class="Q">
	  How to report a bug in the compilers?
	</div>
	<div class="A">
	  Use the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/" >bug tracking
	  system</a> to browse bug reports and features request, and
	  submit new ones.

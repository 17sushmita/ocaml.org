<h1><span>Stream Expressions</span></h1>
<a name="Stream_Expressions"></a><h2><span>Stream Expressions</span></h2>
<p class="first_para">Streams are very powerful and concise once the necessary tools (stream builders, combinators, and other utilities) are in place. However, the code behind these tools can be a chore to write, at times resembling state machines more than elegant functional expressions. The Camlp4 preprocessor adds syntax support for stream and stream parser expressions, raising the level of abstraction a bit higher and simplifying many common stream-oriented tasks.</p>
<a name="Interactive_Use"></a><h2><span>Interactive Use</span></h2>
<p class="first_para">To enable stream expression support in the toplevel, you can type the following:</p>
<pre>
# #load &quot;dynlink.cma&quot;;;
# #load &quot;camlp4o.cma&quot;;;
</pre>

<p class="first_para">Or, if you are using findlib:</p>
<pre>
# #use &quot;topfind&quot;;;
# #camlp4o;;
</pre>

<a name="Stream_Literals"></a><h2><span>Stream Literals</span></h2>
<p class="first_para">Stream expressions are enclosed by &quot;[&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;]&quot; brackets, and using them is a lot like using lists. The simplest stream possible is the empty stream:</p>
<pre>
[&lt; &gt;]
</pre>

<p class="first_para">Literal values in stream expressions are prefixied by single-quotes:</p>
<pre>
[&lt; '1; '2; '(1 + 2) &gt;]  (* Equivalent to Stream.of_list [1; 2; 3] *)
</pre>

<p class="first_para">This is to distinguish them from streams, which are automatically concatenated:</p>
<pre>
[&lt; '1; '2; more_numbers; '99 &gt;]
</pre>

<p class="first_para">In the above example, the stream will produce the integers 1 and 2, followed by all of the values generated by the <code>more_numbers</code> stream, and once <code>more_numbers</code> as been exhausted, it will produce the integer 99.</p>
<a name="Recursive_Definition"></a><h2><span>Recursive Definition</span></h2>
<p class="first_para">Streams can be defined with recursive functions, providing a straightforward and familiar mechanism to produce infinite sequences. The following defines an never-ending stream of 1s:</p>
<pre>
let ones =
  let rec aux () =
    [&lt; '1; aux () &gt;] in
  aux ()
</pre>

<p class="first_para">Note the auxiliary function, <code>aux</code>, which is called recursively to form a loop. This is necessarily different from infinite lists, which can be defined with &quot;let rec&quot; without a helper function:</p>
<pre>
# let rec ones = 1 :: ones;;
val ones : int list =
  [1; 1; 1; 1; 1; ...]
</pre>

<p class="first_para">The stream expression syntax is not able to interpret recursive values like this, and attempts to do this will result in a syntax error:</p>
<pre>
# let rec ones = [&lt; '1; ones &gt;];;
Error: This kind of expression is not allowed
as right-hand side of `let rec'
</pre>

<p class="first_para">This is only a minor inconvenience, since most streams will be built from one or more parameters.  For example, here is the <code>const_stream</code> from the <a href="streams.html" class="internal" title="Streams">Streams</a> chapter, redefined using stream expression syntax:</p>
<pre>
let rec const_stream k = [&lt; 'k; const_stream k &gt;]
</pre>

<p class="first_para">Similarly, this simple one-liner is all it takes to produce a counter:</p>
<pre>
let rec count_stream i = [&lt; 'i; count_stream (i + 1) &gt;]
</pre>

<p class="first_para">Below is a slightly more complicated example, using two stream expressions to define a Fibonacci sequence:</p>
<pre>
# let fib =
    let rec aux a b =
      [&lt; '(a + b); aux b (a + b) &gt;] in
    [&lt; '0; '1; aux 0 1 &gt;];;
  val fib : int Stream.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# Stream.npeek 10 fib;;
- : int list = [0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34]
</pre>

<a name="Example__Directory_walker"></a><h2><span>Example: Directory walker</span></h2>
<p class="first_para">As a more practical example, we can define a recursive directory walker that avoids loading the entire directory tree into memory:</p>
<pre>
let rec walk dir =
  let items =
    try
      Array.map
        (fun fn -&gt;
           let path = Filename.concat dir fn in
           try
             if Sys.is_directory path
             then `Dir path
             else `File path
           with e -&gt; `Error (path, e))
        (Sys.readdir dir)
    with e -&gt; [| `Error (dir, e) |] in
  Array.fold_right
    (fun item rest -&gt;
       match item with
         | `Dir path -&gt; [&lt; 'item; walk path; rest &gt;]
         | _ -&gt; [&lt; 'item; rest &gt;])
    items
    [&lt; &gt;]
</pre>

<p class="first_para">This function works by first assembling an array of paths for the specified base directory. Each path is wrapped in a variant type that keeps track of which path is a file and which is a directory. The array is then folded into a stream, expanding each subdirectory by recursively calling <code>walk</code> again. Errors are included in the variant so that exceptions can be handled or ignored as needed.</p>
<p>The expanding of subdirectories</p>
<pre>
[&lt; 'item; walk path; rest &gt;]
</pre>

<p class="first_para">illustrates a convenient feature of stream expressions: any number of sub-streams can appear in any order, and they will be lazily evaluated as needed. <code>walk path</code> and <code>rest</code> both evaluate to streams that are concatenated with <code>item</code> at the front. The results are flattened into a single stream, just as if we had used something like <code>stream_concat</code>, defined in the <a href="streams.html" class="internal" title="Streams">Streams</a> chapter.</p>
<p>With little effort, we can now print the names of all the directories and files underneath &quot;/var/log&quot;:</p>
<pre>
let () =
  Stream.iter
    (function
       | `Dir path -&gt;
           Printf.printf &quot;dir: %s%!\n&quot; path
       | `File path -&gt;
           Printf.printf &quot;file: %s%!\n&quot; path
       | `Error (path, e) -&gt;
           Printf.printf &quot;error: %s (%s)%!\n&quot; path
             (Printexc.to_string e))
    (walk &quot;/var/log&quot;)
</pre>

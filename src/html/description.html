    OCaml provides safety features to stop programmers from shipping
    programs with bugs. This section describes some of these safety
    features.

    <h3>Type safety</h3>

    <h4>Static type checking</h4>

    OCaml enforces type safety rigorously when the program is
    compiled. Consequently, it isn't possible to compile a program
    which confuses a string with a number, or one object with another
    incompatible object.

    <h4>Type inference</h4>

    OCaml literally works out the types of every expression and variable
    in your program, so you don't have to.

    You can also change one part of a program and have the compiler tell
    you which other parts of the program that change affects, even if the
    change is in a part of the program which doesn't run, such as an
    obscure error handling routine.

    <h3>Automatic garbage collection</h3>

    Garbage collection is the cornerstone of all modern computer
    languages, and OCaml contains one of the fastest garbage
    collectors (GC) in any programming language. Forget about the
    slow, bloated GC in languages like Java. OCaml's GC is nimble and
    small.

    <h3>Bounds checking</h3>

    OCaml automatically enforces array boundaries, and will throw an
    exception if the program tries to access an element outside the
    bounds of an array.

    When speed matters above all else, you can turn this feature off at compile time.

	History of Caml</a>" for an account of the origins of the
      language.

    <h1>What is OCaml?</h1>

    <h2><a name="safety">Safety</a></h2>

    OCaml provides safety features to stop programmers from shipping
    programs with bugs. This section describes some of these safety
    features.

    <h3>Type safety</h3>

    <h4>Static type checking</h4>

    <p>
      OCaml enforces type safety rigorously when the program is
      compiled. Consequently, it isn't possible to compile a program
      which confuses a string with a number, or one object with another
      incompatible object.
    </p>

    <h4>Type inference</h4>

    <p>
      OCaml literally works out the types of every expression and variable
      in your program, so you don't have to.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also change one part of a program and have the compiler tell
      you which other parts of the program that change affects, even if the
      change is in a part of the program which doesn't run, such as an
      obscure error handling routine.
    </p>

    <h3>Automatic garbage collection</h3>

    <p>
      Garbage collection is the cornerstone of all modern computer
      languages, and OCaml contains one of the fastest garbage
      collectors (GC) in any programming language. Forget about the
      slow, bloated GC in languages like Java. OCaml's GC is nimble and
      small.
    </p>

    <h3>Bounds checking</h3>

    <p>
      OCaml automatically enforces array boundaries, and will throw an
      exception if the program tries to access an element outside the
      bounds of an array.
      
      When speed matters above all else, you can turn this feature off at compile time.
      
    </p>

    <h2><a name="speed">Speed</a></h2>

    The INRIA official OCaml website has a page on optimising OCaml
    programs for speed and one on writing efficient numerical code.

    <h2><a name="portable-programs">Portable programs</a></h2>

    <p>
      OCaml makes it quite simple to write portable programs which will work
      across Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Unix from a single codebase.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page describes the choices available to companies that
      need to write programs across all platforms.
    </p>

    <h3>Command line, background, server programs</h3>

    <p>
      Cross platform programs without a Graphical User Interface (GUI) can
      easily be written directly in OCaml. To port such programs to Windows,
      simply avoid using a few Unix-specific features of the standard
      library. See the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/index.html">OCaml manual</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Graphical (GUI) programs</h3>

    <p>
      To develop successful cross-platform programs with Graphical User
      Interfaces (GUIs), simply choose the right cross-platform library.
    </p>

    <h4>Gtk</h4>

    <p>
      The right cross-platform library usually is Gtk, which has
      comprehensive OCaml bindings called lablgtk2. Gtk is available on
      Windows, Linux and Unix. Gtk for Mac OS X requires the Apple X Server
      subsystem, which usually is only an issue for those running Mac OS X
      versions before 10.3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gtk Wimp is a Windows theme which makes Gtk programs running under
      Windows look like native Windows programs. Gtk Wimp is fully
      integrated into Gtk.
    </p>

    <h3>Build environment</h3>

    <p>
      When developing a cross-platform application with OCaml, we
      recommend the <a href="omake.metprl.org">OMake Build
      System</a>. OMake is an alternative to GNU Make and the GNU tools
      that was developed in OCaml. OMake's library of default build
      recipes has extensive support for OCaml programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      For platform independent version control, we strongly recommend
      Concurrent Versioning System (CVS).
    </p>

    <p>Alternatives to CVS include Subversion and Arch.</p>

    <h3>Installer</h3>

    <p>
      Since every platform has its own packaging system and installation
      requirements, there is no "cross-platform installer". However, a
      Makefile-based build environment allows one to easily generate
      packages for each platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Windows we suggest using NSIS which has a simple text-based
      configuration file and can be driven from a Makefile.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Linux you can build either RPMs or Debian DEBs using the standard tools.

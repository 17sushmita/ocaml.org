  <h1>Caml Light</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Caml Light is a lightweight, portable implementation of the Caml
  language.  that runs on most Unix machines, as well as PC under
  Microsoft Windows.  Because of its stable status, it is actively
  used in education. For most other uses, we recommend switching to
  its successor OCaml.</p>

  <p>Caml Light is implemented as a bytecode compiler, and fully
  bootstrapped.  The runtime system and bytecode interpreter is
  written in standard C, hence Caml Light is easy to port to almost
  any 32 or 64 bit platform. The whole system is quite small: about
  100K for the runtime system, and another 100K of bytecode for the
  compiler. Two megabytes of memory is enough to recompile the whole
  system.</p>

  <h2>Availability</h2>
  <p>The Caml Light system is open source software, please read its <a

  release</a> can be freely downloaded on this site, together with its

  manual</a>. See also <a

  programming using Caml Light</a> for an introduction to functional

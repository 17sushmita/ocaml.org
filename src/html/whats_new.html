    <h1>What's new in OCaml</h1>

    <p>This page summaries briefly the improvements that appeared in
      recent releases of OCaml.</p>

    <h2>4.00.1</h2>

    <p>This is mostly
      a <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.00/notes/Changes"
	   >bugfix release</a>.</p>

    <h2>4.00.0</h2>
    
    <p>Some of the highlights in release 4.0.0 (July 2012) are:</p>
    <ul><li> The name the language is now officially
        "OCaml", and this name is used consistently in all the
        documentation and tool outputs. </li>
      <li> Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs): this is a
	powerful extension of the type system that provides great
	flexibility and power to the programmer. </li>
      <li> A new and improved ARM back-end. </li>
      <li> Changes to first-class modules: type annotations can
	now be omitted when packing and unpacking modules (and are
	inferred from context whenever possible), and first-class
	modules can now be unpacked by pattern-matching. </li>
      <li> Support for randomized hash tables to avoid
	denial-of-service vulnerabilities. </li>
      <li>Installation of the compiler's internal libraries in
        <code>+compiler-libs</code> for easier access by third-party
        programming tools. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3.12</h2>

    <p>Some of the highlights in release 3.12 are:</p>
    <ul><li> Polymorphic recursion is supported, using explicit
	type declarations on the recursively-defined
	identifiers.</li>
      <li> First-class modules: module expressions can be
	embedded as values of the core language, then manipulated
	like any other first-class value, then projected back to
	the module level.</li>
      <li> New operator to modify a signature a posteriori:
	<code>S with type t := tau</code> denotes
	signature <code>S</code> where the <code>t</code> type
	component is removed and substituted by the
	type <code>tau</code> elsewhere.</li>
      <li> New notations for record expressions and record
	patterns: <code>{ lbl }</code> as shorthand for <code>{
	  lbl = lbl }</code>, and <code>{ ...; _ }</code> marks
	record patterns where some labels were intentionally
	omitted.</li><li> Local open <code>let open ... in
	  ...</code> now supported by popular demand.</li>
      <li> Type variables can be bound as type parameters to
	functions; such types are treated like abstract types
	within the function body, and like type variables
	(possibly generalized) outside.</li>
      <li> The <code>module
	  type of</code> construct enables to recover the module
	type of a given module.</li><li> Explicit method override
	using the <code>method!</code> keyword, with associated
	warnings and errors.</li>
    </ul>

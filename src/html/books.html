  <i>Damien Doligez, Alain Frisch, Jacques Garrigue, Didier Rémy, and
  Jérôme Vouillon</i>
  <p>The complete reference guide to OCaml. Updated for each version
  of OCaml, it contains the description of the language, of its
  extensions, and the documentation of the tools and libraries
  included in the official distribution.</p>

  <h3>Camlp4 - Reference Manual</h3>
  <div>
    <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-camlp4/index.html">Online</a>
  </div>
  <i>Daniel de Rauglaudre</i>
  <p>Camlp4 is a Pre-Processor-Pretty-Printer for OCaml. It offers
  syntactic tools (parsers, extensible grammars), the ability to
  extend the concrete syntax of OCaml (quotations, syntax extensions),
  and to redefine it from scratch. This document holds the directions
  for use of Camlp4 and describes these features. It is written for
  programmers who already know OCaml, and are interested in concrete
  syntax.</p>

  <h3>Introduction to OCaml</h3>
  <div>
    <a href="http://files.metaprl.org/doc/ocaml-book.pdf">PDF</a>
  </div>
  <i>Jason Hickey</i>
  <p>This book is notoriously much more than just an introduction to
  OCaml, it describes most of the language, and is accessible.</p>

  <h3>Developing Applications With OCaml</h3>
  <div>
    <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/html/index.html">Online</a> |
    <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/ocaml-ora-book.pdf">PDF</a>
  </div>
  <i>Emmanuel Chailloux, Pascal Manoury, Bruno Pagano</i>
  <p>This book is a translation of a French book published by
  OReilly. It does not only cover the language, but also the runtime
  and the tools, whose understanding is necessary to actually develop
  a complete project in OCaml.</p>

<div class="book">
  <h3>Unix system programming in OCaml</h3>
  <div>
    <a href="http://ocamlunix.forge.ocamlcore.org/">Online</a>
  </div>
  <i>Xavier Leroy and Didier Rémy</i>
  <p>This is an excellent book on Unix system programming, with an
  emphasis on communications between processes. The main novelty of
  this work is the use of OCaml, instead of the C language that is
  customary in systems programming. This gives an unusual perspective
  on systems programming and on OCaml.  It is assumed that the reader
  is familiar with OCaml and Unix shell commands.</p>

  <h3>Using, Understanding, and Unraveling OCaml</h3>
  <div>
    <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/">Online</a> |
    <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/ocaml.pdf">PDF</a>
  </div>
  <i>Didier Rémy</i>
  <p>This book describes both the OCaml language and the theoretical
  grounds behind its powerful type system. A good complement to other
  books on OCaml.</p>

  <h3>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</h3>
  <div>
    <a href="http://thinkocaml.com/">Online</a>
  </div>
  <i>Nicholas Monje and Allen Downey</i>
  <p>This book is an introductory programming textbook based on the
  OCaml language. It is a modified version of <u>Think Python</u> by
  Allen Downey. It is intended for newcomers to programming and also
  those who know some programming but want to learn programming in the
  function-oriented paradigm, or those who simply want to learn
  OCaml.</p>

<p>OCaml currently suffers from a lack of paperback books. New books
are on the way, but in the meantime, you can easily find up-to-date
books on OCaml online here.</p>

<h2>Online Books on OCaml</h2>

<!-- Note: book names should always be underlined -->
<ul>
  <li> <u>Introduction to OCaml</u> by J. Hickey (<a href="http://files.metaprl.org/doc/ocaml-book.pdf">PDF</a> [<a href="files/hickey-ocaml-book.pdf">cached</a>]).
    <p>
      This book is notoriously much more than just an introduction to
      OCaml, it describes most of the language, and is accessible.

  <li><u>Developing Applications With OCaml</u> by E. Chailloux, P. Manoury and B. Pagano
    (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/html/index.html">Online</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/ocaml-ora-book.pdf">PDF</a>
    [<a href="files/ocaml-ora-book.pdf">cached</a>]).
    <p>
      This book is a translation of a French book published by
      OReilly. It does not only cover the language, but also the
      runtime and the tools, whose understanding is necessary to
      actually develop a complete project in OCaml.

  <li><u>Unix system programming in OCaml</u> by Xavier Leroy and
    Didier RÃ©my (<a href="http://ocamlunix.forge.ocamlcore.org/">Online</a>).
    <p>
      This is an excellent book on Unix system programming, with an
      emphasis on communications between processes. The main novelty of
      this work is the use of OCaml, instead of the C
      language that is customary in systems programming. This gives an
      unusual perspective on systems programming and on OCaml.
    </p>

  <li><u>Using, Understanding, and Unraveling OCaml</u>
    by D. Remy (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/">Online</a>,
    <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/ocaml.pdf">PDF</a>
    [<a href="files/remy-ocaml.pdf">cached</a>]).
    <p>
      This book describes both the OCaml language and the theoretical
      grounds behind its powerful type system. A good complement to
      other books on OCaml.

  <li><u>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</u> by Nicholas
    Monje and Allen Downey (<a href="http://thinkocaml.com/">Online</a>).
